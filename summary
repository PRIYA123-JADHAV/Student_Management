Today I created a Student Management System using Node.js, Express, and REST API.
I built endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manage student records stored in a temporary array.
I used CORS and express.json() to allow backend communication.
On the frontend, I used HTML + JavaScript Fetch API to call the backend and display results.
The project helped me understand how REST APIs work, how HTTP methods perform different operations, and how frontend interacts with backend.
